# Welcome to week 1 of introduction to programming

# example of an integer type
integer = 32

# example of a floating point number type
floatingPoint = 1.00235

# example of a string type
string = "This is a python string"

#example of a character type (does not exist in python, but its good to learn)
char = 'a'

boolean = True

if char == "a":
    print(integer + floatingPoint)

if boolean:
    print(string)

# In programming, we need to learn to work on things by assigning variables,
# for instance: if we were to say 35 + 65, the result of this operation 
# would be an integer type. However, unless we assign a variable to the result,
# we cannot access it. 

var1 = 35
var2 = 65

result = var1 + var2

print(result)
