# Weeks 4-7: Fundamentals of Data Structures
1.1 What are Data Structures?

    Definition and purpose of data structures
    How data structures organize and store data efficiently
    The data structures that build Operating systems and 
    execute programs. Introduce the idea of Buffers, 
    how they apply to accessing and manipulating data.

1.2 Array-Based Data Structures

    Introduction to arrays and their characteristics
    Exploring linear data structures: stacks and queues
    Understanding their implementation and operations
    LIFO - The typical "stack"
    FIFO - Queue (asynchonous Queues)

2.2 Binary Search Trees (BST)

    Introduction to BSTs and their applications
    BST operations: insertion, deletion, and search
    Complexity analysis of BST operations
    Balancing BSTs: AVL trees and Red-Black trees

2.3 Heaps

    Introduction to heaps and their purpose
    Heap operations: insertion, deletion, and heapify

    Analyzing the efficiency of algorithms using Big O
    Best, worst, and average case scenarios

4.2 Selecting the Right Data Structure

    Guidelines for choosing the appropriate data structure
    Considering efficiency, memory usage, and required operations
    Real-world examples and trade-offs

4.3 Overview of Popular Programming Languages and Data Structures

    Comparison of data structure implementations in popular languages
