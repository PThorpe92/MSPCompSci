# Logic Gates:
Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of digital circuits. They are electronic devices or circuits that perform logical operations on one or more binary inputs to produce a binary output. There are several types of logic gates, including AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, and NOR gates. Each gate follows specific logical rules to process the input signals and generate the corresponding output signal based on those rules.

# CPU (Central Processing Unit):
The Central Processing Unit, or CPU, is the core component of a computer responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. It consists of several key elements, including the control unit, arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and registers.

- 1. Control Unit: The control unit manages the execution of instructions and coordinates the activities of other CPU components. It fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and directs the flow of data between different parts of the CPU and memory.

- 2. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): The ALU performs arithmetic (addition, subtraction, etc.) and logical (AND, OR, etc.) operations on binary data. It operates on binary inputs received from registers and produces results based on the specific instruction being executed.

- 3. Registers: Registers are small, high-speed storage units within the CPU. They store temporary data, instructions, and addresses. The most commonly used registers include the program counter (PC), which keeps track of the memory address of the next instruction to be fetched, and the accumulator, which stores intermediate results during computations.

# CPU Operation:
The CPU executes instructions in a cycle known as the fetch-decode-execute cycle:

- 1. Fetch: The control unit fetches the next instruction from memory based on the value stored in the program counter.

- 2. Decode: The control unit decodes the fetched instruction to determine the operation to be performed and the operands involved.

- 3. Execute: The control unit coordinates the necessary actions to execute the instruction. It may involve accessing data from memory or registers, performing arithmetic or logical operations in the ALU, and storing the results back in registers or memory.

This fetch-decode-execute cycle repeats continuously, allowing the CPU to process instructions and perform computations. The CPU interacts with other components of the computer system, such as memory and input/output devices, to carry out tasks and perform the desired operations.
