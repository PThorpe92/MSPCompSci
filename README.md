# Computer Science and Programming
# Weeks 1-3 Planner:

## Week 1: Logic Gates

- Overview of logic gates and their importance in digital circuits.
- Explanation of commonly used logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, and NOR gates.
- Understanding the logical operations performed by each gate.
- Discussion on how logic gates are implemented using electronic components, such as transistors.
- Introduction to truth tables and their role in describing the behavior of logic gates.
- Hands-on exercises and examples to reinforce understanding of logic gates.

## Week 2: CPU (Central Processing Unit)

- Comprehensive introduction to the CPU, the core component of a computer.
- Exploring the main elements of a CPU: control unit, arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and registers.
- Functionality and responsibilities of the control unit, including instruction fetching and decoding.
- Role of the ALU in performing arithmetic and logical operations on binary data.
- Understanding registers and their importance in storing data and instructions.
- Detailed explanation of the fetch-decode-execute cycle and its significance in CPU operation.
- Discussion on how the CPU interacts with memory and I/O devices to execute instructions.

## Week 3: Data Types

- Introduction to data types and their significance in programming.
- Explanation of fundamental data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans.
- Understanding the range and limitations of different data types.
- Overview of derived data types, including arrays, strings, and structures.
- Exploring the concept of variables and how they are used to store data of different types.
- Discussion on type conversion and typecasting.
- Practical exercises to reinforce understanding of data types and their usage in programming.

Throughout these weeks, there will be interactive sessions, coding exercises, and assignments to apply the concepts learned. Regular assessments will also be conducted to track progress and ensure comprehension of the material.
